feat: Migrate API routes and seeding to Supabase

This commit migrates the application's API routes from using Prisma to directly interacting with Supabase.
It also updates the `prisma/seed.ts` script to populate the Supabase database with initial data.

Key changes include:
- Replaced Prisma client with Supabase client in all API route handlers.
- Modified `prisma/seed.ts` to use Supabase for data insertion and deletion, including UUID generation for Sale IDs.
- Configured `prisma/schema.prisma` to use PostgreSQL for Supabase schema management.
- Added necessary dependencies: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `cross-env`, `dotenv`, `uuid`.
- Updated `package.json` scripts for `seed` and `db:push-supabase` to support Supabase integration.
- Created `src/lib/supabase.ts` for centralized Supabase client initialization.
- Ensured type safety for environment variables in Supabase client initialization.
